   - Reproduction steps
   - A proof of concept (if available)
   - Suggested remediation (optional)

## Response SLA

- Initial triage response: within 3 business days
- Status update: within 7 business days

## Disclosure

After a fix is available, coordinated public disclosure is preferred. Credit will be given unless you request anonymity.
